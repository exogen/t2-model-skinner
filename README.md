## Development

Clone the repository and run:

```sh
npm install
```

Then run `npm start` to launch the development server:

```sh
npm start
```

Build the production version of the app with `npm run build`:

```sh
npm run build
```

You will also need to clone the [t2-skins](https://github.com/exogen/t2-skins)
repository, which is the source for all the custom skins that will be listed in
the dropdown menu. Adding a new skin to that repository will make it
automatically appear in the menu during build time.

If [t2-skins](https://github.com/exogen/t2-skins) is not a sibling folder to
`t2-model-skinner`, set the `T2_SKINS_PATH` environment variable to its path.
